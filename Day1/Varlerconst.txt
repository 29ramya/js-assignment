Var 
    var declarations are globally scoped or function/locally scoped.
The scope is global when a var variable is declared outside a function. This means that any variable that is declared with var outside a function block is available for use in the whole window.
var is function scoped when it is declared within a function. This means that it is available and can be accessed only within that function.

Let
    A block is a chunk of code bounded by {}. A block lives in curly braces. Anything within curly braces is a block.
So a variable declared in a block with let  is only available for use within that block.

const
     Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. 
This means that the value of a variable declared with const remains the same within its scope. It cannot be updated or re-declared. So if we declare a variable with const.
